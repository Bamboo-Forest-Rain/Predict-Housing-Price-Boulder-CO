# Predict-Housing-Price-Boulder-CO
This analysis is dedicated to Housing and Community Development (HCD) to maximize the the number of eligible homeowners to take repair tax credit with limited allocation resources. This tax credit program has been launched for 20 years, yet it has been taken by only 11% of the eligible homeowners. HCD is now launching a proactive outreach campaign to homeowners. The goal is to develop a model that can predict the turn out of eligible homeowners with certain character traits after being reached by this new campaign. The main idea is for this model to correctly predict homeowners who take the credit after being reached by the campaign so that the allocation resource is not wasted; in other words, the idea is to develop a model with high sensitivity.
